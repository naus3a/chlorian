# Chlorian
`Chlorian` is a `midi` controller.

It is based on the `trinket m0` board and is meant to be mounted in a stompbox format.

If you're wondering where the name comes from, you should probably re-watch your Star Wars.

## Usage
`Chlorian` has **2 foot switches** and an **RGB led**.

Press a foot switch and you send a midi message. Long press a foot switch and you go to the next (if you long press the right one) or the previous (if you long press the left one) page.

Each page gives you 2 different midi messages. Each page is also color coded, so looking at the led you know which page you're on.
